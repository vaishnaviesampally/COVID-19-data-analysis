 📊 COVID-19 Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Description

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 datasets to understand the global spread, recovery trends, and mortality rates. The analysis uses Python libraries to clean, process, and visualize the data for meaningful insights.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze confirmed, recovered, and death cases.
* Perform country-wise and time-series analysis.
* Identify trends and peak infection periods.
* Visualize data using charts and graphs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation
* **NumPy** – Numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📂 Dataset

* CSV dataset containing:

  * Date
  * Country/Region
  * Confirmed Cases
  * Deaths
  * Recovered Cases
* Data cleaning performed to handle missing values and duplicates.

## 📊 Analysis Performed

* Total global confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases
* Country-wise comparison
* Top 10 affected countries
* Active case calculation
* Daily growth rate analysis
* Time-series trend visualization

## 📈 Visualizations

* Line charts for case trends over time
* Bar charts for country-wise comparison
* Pie charts for distribution analysis
* Heatmaps for correlation insights

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-link>
cd covid-data-analysis
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Step 3: Run Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Key Insights

* Identified peak COVID waves.
* Compared mortality and recovery rates.
* Analyzed country-level impact differences.
* Observed trends in case growth patterns.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Build interactive dashboard (Power BI / Tableau)
* Add predictive modeling using Machine Learning
* Real-time data integration via APIs
